abstract = {Observations of glacier albedo are sparse, despite being a first-order control on net solar radiation and melt rates. Recent and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectrometer missions increase our ability to record changes in albedo over time and space but will require an understanding of uncertainties, especially in areas of rugged terrain. Some of these uncertainties arise from the timing of acquisition and resolution of digital elevation models (DEM) that are used for topographic correction. We use the fine-resolution data (2 m) from the Airborne Coastal Observatory (ACO), an imaging spectroscopy and lidar remote sensing platform, to quantify the expected error from other airborne and satellite scale platforms. First, we describe our retrieval workflow - the Imaging Spectroscopy Snow and Ice Algorithm (ISSIA) that yields spatial retrievals of broadband albedo (BBA), optical grain size, and radiative forcing by light absorbing particles (RFLAP) using the coincident 2 m lidar DEM over mountain glaciers. We use two acquisitions over Place Glacier, British Columbia, Canada that represent typical spring and summer conditions as a baseline from which synthetic datasets were generated to represent data from coarser-scale imaging spectroscopy platforms. Each synthetic dataset was motivated by specific airborne and satellite platform scenarios and quantifies four sources of error: (1) DEM spatial resolution and elevation accuracy, (2) coincident vs non-coincident DEM collection, (3) imagery spatial resolution, and (4) spectral resolution. Use of a 30 m DEM introduced the most error in steep mountain terrain, which primarily increased error in the BBA and RFLAP retrievals. The timing of DEM acquisition mattered most for high-resolution imagery and in areas surrounding the glacier toe where mass loss occurred more rapidly. Coarse-resolution imagery did not fully capture spatial variability in surface properties and topography, which lowered variance and increased overall errors. Coarsening of spectral resolution from 5 nm to 10 nm had minimal impact on surface property retrieval and associated errors were independent of DEM or imagery resolution. A simple energy analysis showed that surface albedo error, due to topographic correction with coarse and non-coincident DEMs, resulted in melt rate errors ranging from 6 to 20% for airborne and 11–20% for satellite scenarios.}

               cover an area of approximately 706,000 square kilometres
               globally1, with an estimated total volume of 170,000 cubic
               kilometres, or 0.4 metres of potential sea-level-rise
               equivalent2. Retreating and thinning glaciers are icons of
               climate change3 and affect regional runoff4 as well as global
               sea level5,6. In past reports from the Intergovernmental Panel
               on Climate Change, estimates of changes in glacier mass were
               based on the multiplication of averaged or interpolated results
               from available observations of a few hundred glaciers by defined
               regional glacier areas7-10. For data-scarce regions, these
               results had to be complemented with estimates based on satellite
               altimetry and gravimetry11. These past approaches were
               challenged by the small number and heterogeneous spatiotemporal
               distribution of in situ measurement series and their often
               unknown ability to represent their respective mountain ranges,
               as well as by the spatial limitations of satellite altimetry
               (for which only point data are available) and gravimetry (with
               its coarse resolution). Here we use an extrapolation of
               glaciological and geodetic observations to show that glaciers
               contributed 27 $\pm$ 22 millimetres to global mean sea-level
               rise from 1961 to 2016. Regional specific-mass-change rates for
               2006-2016 range from -0.1 metres to -1.2 metres of water
               equivalent per year, resulting in a global sea-level
               contribution of 335 $\pm$ 144 gigatonnes, or 0.92 $\pm$ 0.39
               millimetres, per year. Although statistical uncertainty ranges
               overlap, our conclusions suggest that glacier mass loss may be
               larger than previously reported11. The present glacier mass loss
               is equivalent to the sea-level contribution of the Greenland Ice
               Sheet12, clearly exceeds the loss from the Antarctic Ice
               Sheet13, and accounts for 25 to 30 per cent of the total
               observed sea-level rise14. Present mass-loss rates indicate that
               glaciers could almost disappear in some mountain ranges in this
               century, while heavily glacierized regions will continue to
               contribute to sea-level rise beyond 2100.",
