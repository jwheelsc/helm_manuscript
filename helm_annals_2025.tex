\abstract{Helm Glacier is one of four glaciers in Canada with a mass balance record which exceeds 40 years. This World Glacier Monitoring Service reference glacier is strongly out of balance with present day climate. An ice penetrating radar survey reveals a mean and maximum ice thickness of 13 and 35\,m respectively. We combine ice thickness data and altimetric data from repeat lidar surveys to project ice disappearance using simple extrapolation and a regression model which predicts surface elevation change based on incoming shortwave radiation, winter snow accumulation, positive degree days, slope and aspect. Both approaches project the disappearance of Helm Glacier by 2035. From a sensitivity analysis we estimate that Helm Glacier is over 5 $^\circ$C away from its equilibrium mass balance, consistent with the observed temperature change over the period 1950 to present.}

\section{Introduction}

Over the last four years, glaciers in Western Canada and the conterminous US lost twice as much mass as during the period 2010-2019  \citep{Menounos2025}. This mass loss occurred primarily through widespread surface thinning driven by warm, dry conditions and general darkening of glacier surfaces. In terms of surface area, Canada contains about 185,000 km$^{2}$ of glacierized terrain, about one quarter of the global total \citep{rgi70}.  Given the importance of glacier runoff to Canada's economy, the federal government established a network of glacier monitoring sites during the International Hydrological Decade \citep{Ommanney1986}. These sites became operational in 1965 and, ten years later, the Government of Canada added Helm Glacier to its list of monitoring sites given its maritime environment \cite{Ommanney2002}. Helm Glacier is a World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) reference glacier and only one of four glaciers in Canada where mass balance observations exceed 40 years.  In addition to their importance of recording  seasonal-to-annual response of glaciers to climate change, \emph{in situ} glacier monitoring records provides seasonal-to-annual observations required for regional upscaling of glacier mass change \citep{Zemp2019}. The objectives of this short note are to describe recent changes of Helm Glacier and estimate when Helm Glacier is projected to disappear.

\section{Study area and Methods}

Helm Glacier (49$^{\circ}$57’29” N, 122$^{\circ}$59’13” W) lies on the western edge of Garibaldi Provincial Park in the Pacific Ranges of the southern Coast Mountains in the traditional territory of the Squamish Nation (Figure \ref{study_area_map}). The small (0.4 km$^{2}$) glacier's elevation range is from 1780\,m a.s.l. to 2150\,m a.s.l. 

\subsection{Glacier mapping and mass balance surveys}

We digitized the extent of Helm Glacier from end-of-summer spaceborne (Landsat 5,7,8,9) and airborne ortho-imagery, the latter acquired by the Hakai-UNBC Airborne Coastal Observatory \citep{Donahue2023}. We take the product of the ground sampling distance of the imagery and the glaciers perimeter to reflect the uncertainty in our mapping. As described above, Helm Glacier represents a WGMS reference glacier where mass balance measurements follow the stratigraphic method \citep{Kaser2003}. The glacier's seasonal balance is derived from 6-8 ablation stakes positioned along the centreline of the glacier, snow depth probing and end-of-winter snow pits where snow density and stratigraphic observations are made. Those data are used to generate seasonal and annual mass balance for the glacier and by updating the glacier area every few years. 

\subsection{Ice-penetrating radar}

We completed an ice-penetrating radar survey of Helm Glacier on 21 May, 2025. The Blue Systems Integration Ltd. radar system uses resistively-loaded dipole antennas with a centre frequency of ~10 MHz, has 12-bit resolution and yields a sampling rate of up to 250 Megasamples per second \citep{Mingo2010}. The radar system contains a single frequency GNSS system with an accuracy of $\pm$5 m. To increase the vertical accuracy for the glacier surface ($\pm$ 0.5\,m), we acquired airborne Lidar for the surface elevation of the glacier on 24 April, 2025. Details about methods used for Lidar acquisition can be found elsewhere \citep{Menounos2025}.  Observations of surface elevation change from a sonic depth ranger equipped with satellite telemetry \cite{Bevington2025a}, reveals about 1\,m of thinning between our Lidar and radar surveys. We processed the radar data with IceRadarAnalyzer 6.3.1, with an antenna spacing of 15\,m and assuming a velocity through ice at 1.68x10$^{8}$ m s$^{-1}$ \citep{Reynolds2011}. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, we averaged 128 stacks for each trace in the radargram and then applied gain and filtering for identification of bed reflectors. We completed crossover analysis (i.e. where two radar transects overlap) and propagated in quadrature  the uncertainty using one-quarter of the radar wavelength \cite{Reynolds2011} and uncertainty that arises from surface slope to yield an error of ice thickness of $\pm$ 4.5\,m.  2D linear interpolation of the ice thickness data yielded a map of ice thickness (10 m ground sampling distance - GSD ).  

\subsection{Projection of glacier disappearance}

We use an area of 0.01 km$^{2}$ to define the threshold at which point Helm Glacier would cease to exist. To estimate the year when this will occur, we forward model the yearly surface elevation change of Helm Glacier using two approaches described below. Both of these approaches use surface elevation data obtained from repeat Lidar surveys of Helm Glacier completed at the end of ablation season in 2020--2024. These five autumn surveys provide elevation change maps for 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, and those airborne surveys followed the same methods described in Menounos and others (\citeyear{Menounos2025}). Elevation change at a given point can be equated to annual surface mass balance given the thinness of the glacier (i.e. negligible ice dynamics) and minimal extent of retained snow on the glacier (i.e. density-to-mass conversion is simplified). The elevation change maps are downsampled to 10 m GSD to match the ice thickness grid. Co-registration of elevation change maps used methods described in \cite{Nuth2011} and \cite{Hugonnet2022} available in the XDEM package (https://pypi.org/project/xdem/).

Our first approach (method 1) averages the surface elevation change at each grid cell over the four year period, then simply differences this average elevation change from the ice thickness grid each year. Ice vanishes at a given grid cell when the total melt exceeds the ice thickness of the column. The error in area is simply taken by recomputing the elevation change within the ice thickness error bounds of $\pm$4.5\,m. 

For the second approach (method 2), we use a regression model to predict elevation change $\mathbf{dh}^{y}$ based on the design matrix of observations $\mathbf{X}^{y}$ for each of the years $j=\{2021,\,2022,\,2023,\,2024\}$ for each of the $n$ grid cells (method 2). Linear regression can be used to model mass change at the regional \citep{Lliboutry1974,Anilkumar2023,Reynaud1986} to individual ablation stake scale \citep{Zekollari2018}. The matrix $\mathbf{X}^{y}$ is composed of slope ($\boldsymbol{\theta}^{y}$), orientation ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}^{y}$), positive-degree days ($\mathbf{PDD}^{y}$), shortwave radiation at the surface ($\mathbf{SW_{\downarrow}}^{y}$) and snow depth ($\mathbf{h}^{y}$). The regression $\mathbf{dh} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is computed on the matrix $\mathbf{X}$ and observations $\mathbf{dh}$ that are concatenated across the four-year record. The optimal coefficients are estimated through least-squares regression as, $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{M}$. The model is validated by modelling the surface change for each year individually as $\hat{\mathbf{M}}^{j} = \mathbf{X}^{j} \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, with the $R^2$ computed between the yearly difference in observed and modelled elevation change at each grid cell. 

Computed PDDs are summed in the time intervals given by the LiDAR acquisition dates as $\mathbf{PDD}^y = \frac{1}{24}\sum T(z)$ for $T>0^{\circ}$C. The temperature ($T$) is taken from dynamically downscaled hourly ERA-5 land temperatures \citep{Hersbach2020} given at the nearest grid point and lapsed up from 1550\,m to the elevation of each grid cell. Similar to the melt-season lapse rate computed by \cite{Shea2009} of -6.0$\mathrm{^{\circ}C\,km^{-1}}$, we calculate April to October lapse rates from a series of nearby weather stations as -5.8$\mathrm{^{\circ}C\,km^{-1}}$. We compute annual  snow depth for the glacier using snow depth collected each April at the stake locations which yields a relation between snow depth and elevation. Summer (May-Sept) incoming shortwave radiation is computed my multiplying a shading factor matrix computed in the HORAYZON v1.2 model \citep{Steger2022} with the mean of the daily averaged downwelling shortwave radiation obtained from the nearest gridpoint of ERA5-Land reanalysis. Although the shading model and surface normal shortwave radiation both depend on surface slope and aspect, we include slope and aspect as individual columns in the design matrix to capture other mass balance processes like snow redistribution.

To forward model the ice loss, we start with the 2024 DEM and force the model with the average of the PDD fields from 2014 to 2024, all computed at the 2024 grid cell elevations from April 01 to October 31. The forcing for $\mathbf{SW_{\downarrow}}$ and the snow depth field $\mathbf{h}$ field are generated from averaging the 2020--2024 fields used in the regression model. At each step forward in time, we recompute the surface elevation, slope, aspect, $\mathbf{PDD}$ and snow-depth fields, but keep $\mathbf{SW_{\downarrow}}$ fixed in time. We estimate uncertainty in elevation change by initializing the ice thickness at the $\pm 4.5$\,m error bounds and by varying the lapse rate by $\pm 5\%$. 

\subsection{Mass balance sensitivity}
We test the net mass balance ($b_n$) sensitivity of our model to changes in temperature as $\mathrm{C_T} = \frac{\partial b_n}{\partial T}$ and precipitation as $\mathrm{C_P} = \frac{\partial b_n}{\partial P}$ by varying the mean summer temperature and the mean winter accumulation of the model  \citep[e.g.][]{Cuffey2010}. Numerical derivatives for $\mathrm{C_T}$ and $\mathrm{C_P}$ are computed for the current temperature and accumulation conditions. We test the sensitivity of: i) yearly specific mass balance using the 2024 reference surface \citep[e.g.][]{Elsberg2001}; and ii) integrated mass balance by allowing the accumulation area to grow from the 2024 reference surface. In the forward model for sensitivity, PDDs are calculated at each grid cell for each incremental temperature change, whereas changes in winter accumulation are input directly into the regression equation. To convert elevation change to mass loss (m w.e.), cells with negative elevation change are multiplied by an elevation-to-mass conversion factor of 0.917. Positive elevation changes indicative of snow accumulation are multiplied by a factor of 0.41, which we derive from the integrated snow pit density averaged from up to two pit locations per year since 1997.  We compute the percent change in temperature from the mean ERA5-Land summer temperature at the mean elevation of the glacier from 2014--2024. The percent change in accumulation is computed by normalizing the offset in accumulation by the glacier-wide average snow depth field used in the forward model. We compare our modelled temperature sensitivities to observed sensitivities at Helm Glacier, computed as the slope of the regression between ERA5-Land mean summer temperature and net specific mass balance from 1975 to 2024 from glaciological mass balance data \citep{WGMS2024}.

\subsection{Mass balance sensitivity}

We test the net mass balance ($b_n$) sensitivity of our model to changes in temperature as $\mathrm{C_T} = \partial b_n/ \partial T$ and precipitation as $\mathrm{C_P} = \partial b_n/ \partial P$. Sensitivities are computed by varying the mean summer temperature and the mean winter accumulation of the model \citep[e.g.][]{Cuffey2010}. Numerical derivatives for $\mathrm{C_T}$ and $\mathrm{C_P}$ are computed for the current temperature and accumulation conditions. We test the sensitivity of i) yearly specific mass balance using the 2024 reference surface \citep[e.g.][]{Elsberg2001} and ii) integrated mass balance by allowing the accumulation area to grow from the 2024 reference surface. In the forward model for sensitivity, PDDs are calculated at each grid cell for each incremental temperature change, whereas changes in winter accumulation are input directly into the regression equation. To convert elevation change to mass loss in m w.e., cells with negative elevation change are multiplied by an ice density factor of 0.917. Positive elevation changes indicative of snow accumulation are multiplied by a density factor of 0.41, which is the integrated snow pit density averaged from up to two pit locations per year from 14 years of spring surveys dating back to 1997. We compute the percent change in temperature by normalizing by the mean ERA5-Land summer temperature at the mean elevation of the glacier from 2014--2024. The percent change in accumulation is computed by normalizing the offset in accumulation by the glacier-wide average snow depth field used in the forward model. We compare our modelled temperature sensitivities to observed sensitivities at Helm Glacier, computed as the slope of the regression between ERA5-Land mean summer temperature and net specific mass balance from 1975 to 2024 from glaciological mass balance data \citep{WGMS2024}.
\section{Results}

Helm Glacier reached its maximum Holocene extent (4.5 km$^{2}$) at about 1690-1710 CE \citep{Koch2009}. Except for period of slowed recession with a minor advance between the late 1960’s and 1970’s, Helm Glacier experienced widespread thinning with attendant shrinkage throughout the Twentieth Century \citep{Koch2009}. Between 1928 and 2024, Helm Glacier lost about 90 \% of its surface area with notable accelerated area loss after 2015 (Figure \ref{area}). Pronounced retreat and thinning over the last eight years led to fragmentation of the glacier in its uppermost elevations.  Marginal retreat along the glacier's mid section will split the lower and upper portions of the glacier within a year or two (Figure \ref{study_area_map}). 

Since 1975, Helm Glacier experienced only five years of positive mass balance \citep{WGMS2024}. Recent imagery of the glacier reveals widespread loss of firn with negligible accumulation area especially over the last four years. Glaciological mass balance data averaged over the past seven years show an annual balance at the terminus of -3.6\,m w.e. and -1.6\,m w.e. at the summit. During that time period, the yearly accumulation averaged over the entire glacier was 1.85\,m w.e. From 1984 to present, Helm Glacier experienced the most negative mass balance of all 16 WGMS monitored glaciers in North America \citep{WGMS2024}. Helm Glacier experienced is most extreme year of mass loss in 2023 (-4.34\, m w.e.), roughly 2.5 times greater than the average of the previous six years. Many glacier in western Canada and the Conterminous US (RGI region 02) experienced pronounced glacier mass loss driven in part by warm, dry conditions \citep{Menounos2025}. 

In addition to climate, changes in glacier area through time is also influenced by underlying terrain as exemplified by the rapid drop in area in the late 1980s as thin ice in the upper basin vanishes (Fig. \ref{area}). Regional trends in accelerated area and mass loss around 2010 \citep{Bevington2022,Menounos2019} and again in 2020 \citep{Menounos2025} cannot be easily distinguished at Helm, though Helm Glacier undergoes accelerating area loss that continues from 2014 to present, which does not appear to be controlled by the basin geometry. 

From the ice-penetrating radar survey we observe that the remaining ice at Helm Glacier is thin, with an average thickness of 13\,m and a maximum thickness of 35\,m. Our projections of surface elevation change indicate that Helm Glacier will vanish within a decade (Figs. \ref{area} and \ref{loss_map}). Helm Glacier is forecast to decrease into fragmented patches of less than 0.1 km$^2$ by 2028$\pm0.5$ (method 1) or by 2029$\pm0.5$ (method 2). Projected area loss patterns are controlled predominately by the remaining ice thickness rather than elevation, orientation and slope. For the linear regression, the $R^2$ is 0.83 and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ values are all statistically significant with $p<0.001$, with the exception of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ for $\mathbf{SW_{\downarrow}}$ at $p=0.065$. Given that slope and aspect account for the greatest spatial variation in incoming shortwave radiation, omitting the $\mathbf{SW_{\downarrow}}$ and snow accumulation fields from the design matrix can lead to model fits for the  2020--2021 and 2023-2024 melt years with $R^2\sim0.7$. However, the reanalysis masked shortwave data are needed to adequately model the high melt season of 2022-2023. Similarly, the design matrix needs to include snow accumulation data to adequately fit the high snow accumulation season of 2021-2022. Relative to the uncertainty in ice depth, the regression model shows little sensitivity to a variation in lapse rate of $\pm 5\%$.

\end{figure}

Calculating the specific balance from the 2024 reference surface shows that a net-zero balance can be achieved with an increase in precipitation of 1.5\,m\,w.e. (36\% mean winter snow accumulation) at the current temperature, or a change in temperature of -6.8$^\circ$C (95\% mean winter snow accumulation) at the current accumulation (Fig. \ref{SMB} a). By allowing the accumulation area to grow, we compute a volumetric balance sensitivity that is slightly more optimistic (Fig. \ref{SMB} b), requiring an increase in precipitation of 1.1\,m\,w.e. (28\%) at the current temperature, or a change in temperature of -5.1$^\circ$C (71\%). 

For current conditions at Helm Glacier, we compute a sensitivity to temperature as $\mathrm{C_T = -0.65\,m\,w.e.\,yr^{-1}\,^\circ C^{-1}}$ while the sensitivity to accumulation is $\mathrm{C_P = 0.97 m\,w.e.\,yr^{-1}\,m\,w.e.^{-1}}$. On a unit-by-unit basis, the glacier is therefore 1.5 times more sensitive to changes in winter accumulation relative to changes in mean summer temperature. However, comparing the sensitivities by percentage change yield $\mathrm{C_P/C_T}=0.84$. The mass balance sensitivities for both the volumetric and specific mass balance methods yield very similar results. Our modelled value of $\mathrm{C_T = -0.65\,m\,w.e.\,yr^{-1}\,^\circ C^{-1}}$ is in agreement to the observed mass balance temperature sensitivity of $\mathrm{C_T = -0.64\,m\,w.e.\,yr^{-1}\,^\circ C^{-1}}$.

\section{Discussion}

Both methods used to project the demise of Helm Glacier indicate that survival of the glacier beyond the next decade is unlikely. Extrapolating the average elevation change forward in time (method 1) is more conservative than the regression model (method 2) because surface parameters like slope, orientation and elevation that are updated at each yearly time step in the regression model create a positive feedback in melt rate, which is not captured with the simple extrapolation. Several intricacies complicate the projected disappearance of Helm Glacier. For each melt season, modelled surface elevation change is  underestimated along the glacier's eastern margin where avalanche accumulation and shading occurs. Elevation change is overestimated at the eastern head of the glacier where snow redistribution by wind causes a reversal of the accumulation gradient. Linearly interpolating and extrapolating snow depth measurements to the snow depth field yields the best $R^2$ averaged across all observation periods, but in cases of extreme years for snow redistribution, a second or third-order polynomial fit can significantly increase the fit at high and low elevations for that year. Given that this thin glacier is strongly out of balance with present-day climate, capturing these finer-scale patterns of accumulation and melt would not change the fate of Helm Glacier's extinction within the decade, however. 

The linear regression model is driven by average temperatures over the past decade and an average snow accumulation field. As such, the forward model does not capture extreme melt events observed regionally and at Helm Glacier. Examples of events and processes that likely make our projections conservative include the intense melt year of 2023 \citep{Menounos2025}, an equilibrium-line elevation that is starting to rise above the head of the glacier \citep{Bevington2025}, surface darkening from wildfire ash deposition that decreases ice albedo \citep{Menounos2025,AubryWake2022} and proglacial lake development leading to basal melt and calving \citep{Carrivick2013,Shugar2020}. These processes that we do not account for should lead to an overestimate of the cooling required to reach equilibrium mass balance (see Fig. \ref{SMB}). However, the temperature shifts that we derive in the sensitivity analyses are consistent with the observed increase in mean summer temperature of 4.6$^\circ$C from 1950 to present at the nearest ERA5-Land grid point. Winter balance data from Helm Glacier over the monitoring period shows no evidence of changes in precipitation that could explain the glacier's disequilibrium.

\section{Conclusion}

Over the last 97 years, Helm Glacier lost 90\% of its surface area, with notable accelerated area and mass loss over the past decade. We estimate that Helm Glacier is over 5$^\circ$C away from equilibrium mass balance conditions under the present-day pattern of winter accumulation. The magnitude of disequilibrium is consistent with an increase in mean summer temperature of roughly 5$^\circ$C from over the last 75 years. These conditions coupled with its thinness implies that the glacier will vanish within the next decade. While the volume of water storage in Helm Glacier is small, the loss of this glacier will reduce the availability of long-term  \emph{in situ} mass balance observations from North America which are essential for improving physically-based models of glacier change.
